Standing instructions allow a user to add preferences or requirements that an agent would like to consider when generating its responses. The user's current utterance in the dialogue has priority over standing instructions. For the given dialogue, which of the following standing instructions are applicable? If no standing instructions are applicable, then generate "None". If some instructions are missing from the current set, generate those instructions under "Remaining Applicable Standing Instructions".
