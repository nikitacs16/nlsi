You are designing a parser that takes in a user utterance and some standing instructions and outputs a set of API calls. 
Every API call consist of "GetX" where X is domain name and uses slot names listed below as arguments.  We list the domain name followed by the list of possible slot names. Some slot names can be categorical or boolean
The values for the arguments can come from the user's dialogue or standing instructions. If the user requests a slot name and no value is found, use "?". If the user requests dontcare, use value as "any".
Standing instructions allow you to add preferences or requirements that youâ€™d like to consider when generating the parser. For the following dialogue, first generate the appropriate applicable standing instructions from the user profile and then generate API calls based on the dialogue and the selected standing instructions.
If standing instructions are applicable across multiple domains, place an API call per situation per domain. 
If some of the applicable standing instructions have instructions of similar type, place multiple API calls respecting the standing instructions.
If some slots are applicable across several domains, generate the respective slot names for the respective domains.
